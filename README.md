hi there! ðŸ‘‹

i'm andrea, a creative front-end software developer with a strong professional and personal interest in design systems and UI/UX.

i love working on the border between design and development. i believe that a strong design system can be one of the most powerful tools in a developer's arsenal. creating beautiful and robust UI, supported by comprehensive documentation, is what i do best.

i work mainly in TypeScript/React environments, but i'm always looking to learn new things! i'm familiar with and always keeping up with all current trends and technologies in the fast-paced world of front-end web developement.
