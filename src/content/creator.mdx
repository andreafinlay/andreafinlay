Creator is a fully-featured music sequencer built right in the browser. ðŸŽµ

Users can select loop-based samples from around the Samples website, add them to
Creator, then listen back, pitch-shift and time-stretch the synchronized tracks.

The completed track can then be export as a whole or by individual sample and imported into a DAW for further tweaking.
