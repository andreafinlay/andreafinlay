Curb Alert is an app for locating abandoned items in your area. ♻️

Users can share images of abandoned items and tag their location on a map, showing other users what free goodies are up for grabs.

Users who post then gain in-app currency, which can be spent to hide existing posts from other users, giving them a chance to claim the items first.
