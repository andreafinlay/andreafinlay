i'm a software developer based in montréal, québec.

i currently work at [LANDR](https://landr.com) as a front-end web developer.

i love working on the border between design and development. i believe that a strong design system can be one of the most powerful tools in a developer's arsenal. creating beautiful and robust UI, supported by comprehensive documentation, is what i do best.

i mainly work in <a href={'https://www.typescriptlang.org/'}>Typescript</a> + <a href={'https://react.dev/'}>React</a> environments, but i'm always looking to learn! i have extensive experience working with new and emerging web technologies and frameworks, such as: <a href={'https://nextjs.org/'}>Next</a>, <a href={'https://www.apollographql.com/'}>GraphQL/Apollo</a>, <a href={'https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction'}>Emotion</a>, <a href={'https://nx.dev/'}>Nx</a>, <a href={'https://pnpm.io/'}>pnpm</a>, <a href={'https://storybook.js.org/'}>Storybook</a>, <a href={'https://vitejs.dev/'}>Vite</a>, <a href={'https://playwright.dev/'}>Playwright</a>, and <a href={'https://jestjs.io/'}>Jest</a>.

in my spare time, i like to read, write, and make music. you might also catch me trying my hand at a number of hobbies, like wood- or metal-work, gardening, or playing tabletop RPGs.

read on to see some of the projects i've worked on, or, if you'd like to get in touch, you can use the <LinkButton onClick={() => {scrollTo('#contact'); setTimeout(() => {window.location.hash = '#contact';}, 700)}}>contact form <Send size={12} /></LinkButton> to shoot me a message.
